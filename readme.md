# Hi, I'm Sergii üëã

Enthusiastically embracing both the creation of new projects from scratch and the enhancement of existing ones, I bring versatility and depth to the development process. My enjoyment in programming is rooted in the philosophy of Robert Martin: *"Good code is like a love letter to the next developer who will maintain it."* This ethos guides my approach, ensuring my code is not just functional but also clear and maintainable.

As a **Java maestro** and experienced **DevOps Engineer**, I specialize in building scalable and efficient systems, blending backend expertise with deployment strategies. My hands-on experience spans **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, and the **Spring ecosystem**, enabling me to deliver robust microservices architectures and automate infrastructure provisioning. I also have a keen focus on cost optimization, having achieved up to 40% savings in cloud expenses.
